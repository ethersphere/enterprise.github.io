To contribute to the text on the Swarm Enterprise Hub - perhaps by catching and correcting some typos - you can use the links to "Edit this page", that should be at the bottom of every page. You will be taken to edit the text via GitHub and commit your suggestions for consideration.

You can also read and comment on the original whitepaper, Swarm storage aspects for enterprises : regaining of sovereignty and trust in the data economy", which addresses these issues in even more detail and provides examples of integrations of Swarm into solutions. To request access to the whitepaper please contact us [via email](enterprise@ethswarm.org).

You might even want to join further efforts in the Enteprise area of research, in which case please also contact us [via email](enterprise@ethswarm.org).
