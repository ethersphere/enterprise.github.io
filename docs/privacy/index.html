They own most of the data about people available and in many cases they ‚Äúknow‚Äù even more about the people than the people themselves due to the big data analytics. As the data is stored on the companies‚Äô/governmental servers (or in the cloud) the <strong>people have low level of actual control</strong> over it and, thus, have to <strong>trust</strong> the government and the companies that they comply with the law and process people‚Äôs personal data according to the rules and their own promises. However, the Cambridge Analytica case, the series of allegations against Facebook and constant news about the <strong>data leaks show quite clearly that this trust doesn‚Äôt pay off</strong> <a href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?wn6Wge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(‚ÄúInstagram Sued For Privacy Violations Over Unauthorized Camera Access - Tech,‚Äù 2020; <em>New Facebook Leak Surfaces</em>, 2019)</a>.</p><p>The current state of the data economy is the basic market of data which the large multinationals (the sellers) are ready to share with the other companies (the buyers). The <strong>people whose data is being sold do not participate in profit sharing</strong> and do not have significant control over the way the data is being sold. The governmental data about people is mostly out of the market (at least under the law).</p><p>Data sharing practices depend on the national legislation. In Europe the introduction of GDPR with quite heavy fines and the activity of certain NGOs (in particular, NOYB led by well-known Max Schrems) made companies be more serious about the way they treat personal data and the data sharing policies they sustain. The recent Schrems II case invalidating the US-EU Privacy Shield is the example of <strong>Europe‚Äôs strong attitude toward better protection of people‚Äôs privacy</strong> <a href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?NBkljb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(HODDER, 2020)</a>. The US approach to personal data regulations, on the other hand, still mainly favors large companies‚Äô interests. The US legislation in this area is fragmented, with no general law existing on the federal level and various approaches being followed by the states (California with the CCPA clearly leading). There are on-going discussions about the US federal law on privacy, but up-to-date it still hardly seems to be enacted in a short-term perspective <a href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?afACGr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(<em>Consolidating US Privacy Legislation</em>, n.d.)</a>.</p><p>Swarm, as a <strong>peer-to-peer storage, may well play a ground-breaking role in this area</strong>. People‚Äôs ability to <strong>store their personal data on Swarm independently</strong> from the multinationals and even the government, and respectively to <strong>share it only with the consent</strong> of the person itself shifts the power and control over personal data from companies back to people. Projects such as Fair Data Society provide people with the opportunity to exercise control over their personal data, limit the companies‚Äô ability to share it without the consent of the person and even gain profit from selling some personal data as a part of large data pools, if the person decides to do so.</p><p>At the moment there are two main concerns in the privacy area faced by the people:</p><p>1) <strong>Lack of control over the personal data processed by the companies/government</strong>;</p><blockquote><p>The data may be transferred to third parties or be held by the companies/government despite the person&#x27;s will to revoke its consent for the processing. Even in the case the company confirms to the person that it has stopped processing and has deleted all of the data, the person still can‚Äôt actually be sure that the company doesn‚Äôt have a backup somewhere (intentionally, or by mistake).</p></blockquote><p>2) <strong>Poor security of the personal data and the high risk of its leakage.</strong></p><blockquote><p>As is well-known, the overall level of strength of the chain is just how strong its weakest link is. Same is true of personal data. The overall level of personal data‚Äôs security is equal to the level of security of the weakest place where it is stored. Individuals usually provide their personal data to many companies processing them in parallel at any given moment (social media, loyalty programs, state services etc). All of these companies at the moment store this personal data on their private servers or on the cloud. So, for example, regardless of how securely the data is stored by the bank, the vulnerability of some small online retailer‚Äôs server may completely compromise the credit card details of the person.</p></blockquote><p>Indeed, the companies face almost similar issues in the privacy area at the moment. They are very much concerned about the security of the personal data and they are interested in ensuring the necessary level of compliance with the personal data regulations, including the rules on data subject access requests and cross-border data transfers (which is now an especially hot topic after the Schrems II decision by the EU Court of Justice <a href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?qeQURh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Elzeiny, 2020; <em>‚ÄúSchrems II‚Äù and Transfers of HR Data</em>, n.d.; <em>The ‚ÄúSchrems II‚Äù Decision</em>, n.d.)</a>). The companies‚Äô engagement in this area is definitely well supported by the heavy fines being put under the GDPR on those who don‚Äôt comply with the law. However, with the to-date technologies it might be hard for the companies to comply with all of the GDPR requirements.</p><p>In this situation <strong>Swarm may become a powerful tool in the right hands both for the people to gain back control over their personal data and for the companies to ensure stronger compliance and security levels</strong>. Swarm is built with privacy-by-design and privacy-by-default models at the core. Its <em>dream</em> protocol (currently under development) will allow the person to securely store his/her personal data on Swarm and provide access to this data to the third parties (companies, government) with the possibility to delete this data when necessary.</p></div></article><div class="margin-vert--xl"><div class="row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/ethersphere/enterprise.github.io/edit/master/docs/privacy.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="1.2em" width="1.2em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" viewBox="0 0 40 40" style="margin-right:0.3em;vertical-align:sub"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div></div></div><div class="margin-vert--lg"><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_3SO_"></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">Community</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://beehive.ethswarm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">BeeHive</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethswarm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Reddit</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/ethswarm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">More</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/ethersphere/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">About this page</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/disclaimer">Disclaimer</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="text--center"><div>Copyright ¬© 2020 Swarm Enterprise Hub.</div></div></div></footer></div>
