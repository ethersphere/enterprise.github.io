**This section has not yet been released to the Swarm Enteprise Hub webpage.**

**The contents of Swarm Enterprise Hub are based largely on the whitepaper "Swarm storage aspects for enterprises :
regaining of sovereignty and trust in the data economy", which addresses these issues in  detail. To request access to the whitepaper please contact us [via email](mailto:enterprise@ethswarm.org).**

Below is a sneak peak at the content.


**Key takeaways:**

-   **Personal data is dominantly owned by governments and large multinationals.**

-   **People have low levels of control over use of their data once transferred to the government/company and do not participate in profit sharing from the data market transactions.**

-   **Swarm offers alternative, self-sovereign storage of personal data for people.**

-   **It may also become a powerful tool for organisations to ensure stronger compliance guarantees and security of the personal data being processed.**
