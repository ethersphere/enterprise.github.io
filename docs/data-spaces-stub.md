regaining of sovereignty and trust in the data economy", which addresses these issues in  detail. To request access to the whitepaper please contact us [via email](mailto:enterprise@ethswarm.org).**

Below is a sneak peak at the content.

**Key takeaways:**

-   **Datasets can be built up from individual level to higher levels based on consent and retaining trust.**
