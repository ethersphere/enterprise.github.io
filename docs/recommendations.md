Encryption and decentralized infrastructure give way to a future where people are truly free in choice and expression. Every person can have their own personal cloud, their own digital private space.

Every company can join such a network, leveraging the data a person chooses to share and building a fair data economy.

Swarm allows for an independent cloud infrastructure where individuals can store their data without any special technical knowledge. Even more, with software layers on top of it, this data could be organized into more elaborate structures and made available for the fair data economy - leveling the playing field for all companies.

Swarm offers infrastructure for private and secure storage under the control of the individual. It offers the option for organisations to offload the data rather seamlessly. The individualâ€™s data store benefits from ever richer datasets, that the organisations can tap back into it when needed. The spoils can be distributed fairly.

Swarm network can support both storage of data and Dapps code in a way, that if the content becomes more popular any increased traffic results in more peers join in the efforts, making the network self-scalable. This is handled by the incentive layer and rewarding peers for storage and bandwidth they provide.

Data in Swarm network is split up and distributed throughout the network in a redundant fashion, by design. This also means geographic diversity. The network also reacts to local demand by providing more capacity, if needed. All the while commodity hardware is used - a network of peers, busy bees, working to provide content.
FairOS layer that is built with Swarm as the underlying cloud infrastructure and open sourced under Fair Data Society, will offer an easy way to leverage the features offered by Swarm and will form the basis of the future for storage and computation - paving the way for the Fair data economy to emerge.
